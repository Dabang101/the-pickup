      <h1> About The Pickup </h1>
      <p> We created this app as a part of the CCSI project. After struggling to come up with an idea, Stephen, a Google Software Engineer, helped us realize that we had something in common. That commonality was our love for playing sports and the spontaniety for when we would play. We often struggle to find places where we can play (that are also free), and this app not only locates a place but also allows users to add their own places common search engines won't find. We hope this app helps when you want to play basketball, ultimate frisbee, or whatever sport you want to play. </p>
